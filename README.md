# mxm-creative-sampler

An MXM instrument: A small-sample sound-design instrument with Repitch, Stretch and Grain playback.

Part of the MXM collection: every instrument, effect and tool lives in its own repository under
[github.com/mxm-audio](https://github.com/mxm-audio), built on
[mxm-kit](https://github.com/mxm-audio/mxm-kit).

## Building

Rust 1.95 or newer. On Linux, install ALSA, JACK, X11, xkbcommon and a GL loader first.

```bash
cargo xtask bundle mxm-creative-sampler --release   # -> target/bundled/mxm-creative-sampler.clap
cargo test
```

Copy `target/bundled/mxm-creative-sampler.clap` into your CLAP folder. This is pre-alpha:
nothing is released, so there are no official builds yet.
